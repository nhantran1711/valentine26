            <p>My Dearest Khanh Ha,</p>

            <p>You’ve found all the hearts, just like you’ve found every little pieces of my heart. I wanted to take this moment to tell you how much you mean to me.</p>
            <p>Every day with you is a gift. From our laughter that lights up even the darkest days, to the quiet moments when just holding your hand makes everything feel perfect. You make ordinary moments extraordinary, and every memory with you is something I treasure deeply.</p>
            <p>I fall in love with you more with every passing day - your smile, your kindness, your patience, your warmth, and the way you make everyone around you feel special. You are my sunshine, my safe place, and the reason I feel complete.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being you. Thank you for letting me love you and for loving me back. I cannot imagine my life without you, and I look forward to all the adventures, laughter, and quiet moments we’ll share together.</p>
            <p>Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. Forever and always,</p>
            
            <p>Your dearest loveee.</p>
